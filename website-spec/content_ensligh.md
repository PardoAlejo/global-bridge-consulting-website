# WHO WE ARE

Title:
Who we are

Body:
We are a consultancy focused on structuring evidence in complex environments.

We combine expertise in information systems, data science, and institutional analysis to transform fragmented information into clear, verifiable tools. Our focus is not technology for its own sake, but the quality, traceability, and usefulness of evidence.

Mission:
To design rigorous systems that organize and connect evidence, enabling better-informed decisions.

Bullets:
- Organization of complex information
- Comparative and analytical systems
- Neutrality and methodological rigor

Our principles:
- References and source links
- Version control and update timestamps
- Coverage and uncertainty signals
- Methodological validation

We operate under a clear principle: structure evidence without advocacy. Our systems prioritize traceability, context, and clarity. When information is incomplete or limited, it is explicitly indicated.
