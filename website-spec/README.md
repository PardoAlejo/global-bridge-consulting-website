# Global Bridge – Website Build Instructions

## Objective

Build a clean, minimalist consultancy website inspired by the layout in `design-reference.png`.

This is NOT a startup landing page.
It must feel:

- Institutional
- Calm
- Neutral
- Structured
- Serious

AI is a tool we use, but it is NOT the focus of the messaging.

---

## Visual Reference

See `design-reference.png`.

We want:

- Top navigation bar (white background, minimal)
- Large hero banner (full width)
- Strong headline on the left side of hero
- Abstract illustration or textured background in hero
- Clean stacked sections
- Generous whitespace
- No flashy gradients
- No stock photos of people

Structure inspiration only — not a pixel copy.

---

## Site Structure (Single Page)

Build a single-page website with anchor navigation.

Sections (in order):

1. Hero
2. Who We Are (includes mission statement and neutrality principles)
3. What We Do (4 capability cards)
4. Projects (3 project cards with status)
5. Contact (form)
6. Footer

Navigation links should scroll to sections.
