# Alejandro Pardo González

Ph.D. in Computer Vision | Generative AI Researcher | Data-Centric Systems Builder  

I build AI systems grounded in mathematical rigor, scalable engineering, and real-world impact.

My work spans:
- 🧠 Generative modeling (diffusion, flow matching)
- 📊 Data-centric AI and evaluation frameworks
- ⚙️ Efficient large-scale training systems
- 🌎 Technology for education and informed decision-making

I care about using AI not only to optimize models — but to elevate understanding.

## 🔬 Research & Technical Work

During my Ph.D. at KAUST (Image and Video Understanding Lab), I worked on:

### Generative Modeling
- Diffusion models (DDPM, DDIM, flow-based views)
- Training-free control mechanisms
- Structured noise manipulation
- LoRA and parameter-efficient adaptation
- Preference optimization (DPO, PPO variants)

### Structured Visual Understanding
- Learning to rank cinematic cuts
- Building and curating large-scale video datasets (MovieCuts)
- MatchDiffusion (ICCV 2025): structured joint/disjoint diffusion for match-cut generation

Across projects, my strength lies in:
- Deriving objectives from first principles
- Implementing naive baselines before optimizing
- Understanding memory/computation tradeoffs
- Designing clean evaluation frameworks

## 🗳 Civic Technology Work

I built an AI-powered chatbot to help citizens better understand the upcoming Colombian elections.

The system:
- Used Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Structured candidate and policy information
- Applied bias-aware prompting strategies
- Focused on clarity, neutrality, and accessibility

The motivation was simple:

> AI should help people think more clearly — not amplify polarization.

I care deeply about technology that:
- Reduces misinformation
- Improves civic literacy
- Expands access to reliable knowledge

## 🌎 What Drives Me

I am Colombian, trained internationally, and motivated by long-term impact.

I am drawn to work that:
- Combines rigor with responsibility
- Uses AI to expand human agency
- Builds systems that inform rather than manipulate

I’m willing to work intensely for something meaningful.

If the mission lacks depth, I optimize for balance.

## 📈 Current Direction

I’m exploring roles and collaborations involving:

- Scalable multimodal AI systems
- Generative modeling research
- Data-centric ML pipelines
- AI tools for education, media, and informed decision-making
- Entrepreneurial AI products

I’m especially interested in teams that combine:
- Technical depth
- Ethical awareness
- Long-term thinking
